## Usage ##
The Study Plan app allows users to enter their current tasks using the Add Tasks button on the sidebar, add subjects in the Subjects button on the sidebar, and then view those tasks as well as generate a study plan for the following week in the Generate Plan sidebar. All tasks can be created, fetched, updated, and deleted with the help of the database.

## OO design ##
In this project, my focus was always on incorporating and demonstrating my understanding of object-oriented principles as well as trying to use tools such as designing UML class diagrams and utilizing test-driven development throughout the project.
